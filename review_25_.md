The site is very informative with well considered areas and good information presentation. If i were to critique, I'd suggest adding interest to the website via the use of images and maybe trying out some CSS to make the webiste a bit colourful!

    Interest of content
Nice use of having different topic areas on different pages - wide range of info!

    Consistency and quality of visual presentation
It is consistent but it is also a little plain at times. I do like the layout of the Medical Research page and it's use of headings and bold text

    Quality of written presentation
lots of lovely thoughoutful info presented nicely in an understandable way

    Validity of HTML
Used links, headings, bold text!

    Evidence of collaboration including
        Author info not written by author
I see author info!
        Balanced contributions from members
each member has their own page and they all contain a good amount of information!
